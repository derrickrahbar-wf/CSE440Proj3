1) all variables must have unique id's
2) Parents must be defined before their children (no circular definitions)
3) If a class has a user-defined type as an attribute, that user-defined 
   type must be defined first (except in the case of attributes of themselve for linked-lists)
4) Any attribute of a class that is also a class is a pointer and thus must be allocated
   memory before use (ex a.b = new BB before use of a.b)
5) setting one class equal to another will create aliases (the pointer value is copied)
6) relational operators on classes will perform these on the value of the pointer
7) printing a variable of a class will print the pointer of that class
8) declaring an array of classes will actually be an array of pointers, you have to 
   instantiate each one if you want to use them (see testmd-10 for example)
9) We do not support negative indexed arrays (can't declare ARRAY[-1..5])
