1) all variables must have unique id's
2) Parents must be defined before their children (no circular definitions)
3) If a class has a user-defined type as an attribute, that user-defined type must be defined first
4) You must new any attribute of a class that is also a class
5) setting one class equal to another will create aliases (the pointer is copied)
6) relational operators on classes will perform these on the value of the pointer
7) printing a variable of a class will print the pointer of that class
